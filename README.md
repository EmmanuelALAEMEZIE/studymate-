## 🚀 Running Locally

### 1. Prerequisites
- **Node.js** (v18.0.0 or later)
- **npm** (v9.0.0 or later)

### 2. Installation
Clone the repository and install all dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Environment Variables & Gemma 4 Gradio Setup
Copy `.env.example` to `.env`:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Set `GEMMA_API_URL` to your live public Gradio URL:
```env
GEMMA_API_URL="https://5d086c7fc6184718a6.gradio.live"
PORT=3000
```

> **Important Notes for Kaggle Gradio Users:**
> - When running Google Gemma 4 E2B Instruct on Kaggle with `demo.launch(share=True)`, Gradio generates a public live URL (e.g., `https://<hash>.gradio.live`).
> - Gradio public tunnels remain active for up to 72 hours while the Kaggle notebook session is active.
> - If you restart your Kaggle notebook, Gradio may generate a new live URL. Simply update `GEMMA_API_URL` in your `.env` file (or your deployment environment) with the new link and restart the server (`npm run dev`).
> - No frontend rebuild is required when changing `GEMMA_API_URL` as the connection is managed exclusively by the backend Express server.

### 4. Start the Application
Start the unified full-stack server (Node.js/Express backend + Vite React frontend):
```bash
npm run dev
```

Open your browser at:
```
http://localhost:3000
```

### 5. Production Build
```bash
npm run build
npm start
```
